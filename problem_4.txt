### PROBLEM 4 SUBMISSION ###

\[
f(N):=\text{ sum of three largest proper divisors of } N,
\]
domain: integers N with d(N) (number of divisors) at least 4 (= at least 3 proper divisors).
Given infinite orbit: a_1,a_2,... , each term in domain, and a_{n+1}=f(a_n), n>=1.
Need all possible a_1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Encoding f via small divisors.

For N with d(N)>=4:
List all divisors of N > 1 (N included), increasing. Let first three be d1<d2<d3.
(Always exist: besides 1 and N, at least two more divisors -> at least 3 divisors >1.)
Basic involution d -> N/d on divisor set reverses order. Exact:
Proper divisors of N are all divisors except N. Largest proper divisors correspond to smallest divisors >1: precisely N/d1, N/d2, N/d3. (If only 3 proper besides N, d3 = N, N/d3=1; fine.)
So exact formula, always:
f(N) = N/d1 + N/d2 + N/d3, where d1<d2<d3 are three smallest divisors of N > 1. Fixed.

So everything is: k1,k2,k3=three smallest divisors >1 of current term.

So need understand possible triples {d1,d2,d3} along orbit.

I'll use that throughout.

Also mod3 little lemma: nonzero residues mod3 are {1,2}, inverse = itself. For x,y,z in {1,2}: x+y+z≡0 mod3 iff x=y=z. Only possibilities 1+1+1, 2+2+2. Exact.

So: for N not multiple of 3, d_i nonzero mod3. And sum N/d_i divisible by3 iff d1,d2,d3 all same mod3. That's used repeatedly.

Now orbit analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Eliminate odd terms.

Lemma 1: In any infinite valid sequence: no odd term.

Proof:
Take odd N with d(N)>=4. All divisors odd. Three smallest >1 are odd distinct.
Distinct odd >=3: so d1>=3, d2>=5, d3>=7.
So f(N) = N/d1+N/d2+N/d3 <= N(1/3+1/5+1/7)=71/105 N < N. strict.
Each summand N/di odd. So f(N) odd and <N.
So if some term is odd, next is odd and smaller. Induct: all following odd, strictly decreasing positive odds – impossible infinite. So cannot.
So in valid infinite orbit: every a_n is even. Exact. Good.

So from now: all terms even.

Need show also all terms multiple of 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Behavior of even numbers not divisible by 3.

Need precise lemma.

Let N even, d(N)>=4, 3 ∤ N. d1=2<d2<d3 three smallest >1, f(N)=N/d1+N/d2+N/d3.

Lemma A (key):

(i) f(N) < N.
(ii) If f(N) is even, then 3 does NOT divide f(N).

So even non-multiple-of-3 can't map to multiple of 3.

Proof of (i): N even, no 3.
d1=2 fixed. 3 not divisor -> d2>=4. distinct -> d3>=5. So
f(N) <= N/2 + N/4 + N/5 = 19/20 N < N. Good.

So strict decrease always when N even non-3.

Now mod3 part (ii). Two 2-adic cases.

Case I: 4|N, 3∤N.
Need show f(N) mod3 nonzero.
N divisible by4, no 3: smallest >1 besides1? d1=2, d2 must be 4 (any odd divisor besides1 at least5, 4 is smaller). So d1=2, d2=4.
Also N not divisible by3 => d3 not divisible by3.
Compute mod3 of f(N): N nonzero mod3.
Each summand N/di nonzero mod3 (divides N, N has no 3). Now mod3 inverses: inv(1)=1, inv(2)=2.
f(N) divisible by3 <-> d1+d2+d3≡0 mod3 (since N factor invertible, inv(di)=di).
Now d1=2 d2=4≡1 mod3, sum d1+d2≡0 mod3. So f(N) mod3 ≡ d3 mod3. d3 nonzero mod3. So nonzero. So 3 ∤ f(N). Exactly.

So case I done.

Case II: N even but not div by4 -> exact v2(N)=1. So N=2k, k odd, 3 ∤ k.

Now structure of d2,d3.

First: d2 is odd.
Reason: smallest odd divisor >1 of N exists (k>1 because N has >=3 proper). call p. Any even divisor besides2: because only one 2, form 2u with u|k odd. Minimal such u>=p -> 2u>p. So among divisors besides {1,2}, smallest is p (odd). That's d2. So d2 odd.

Now assume f(N) is even (in orbit will be). f(N)=N/2 + N/d2 + N/d3. N/2=k odd.
Need parity of N/d for N=2k (k odd):
If d odd: N/d=2*(k/d) even.
If d even (=2u with odd u|k): N/d=k/u odd.
So N/d is odd exactly when d is even.

f(N) = odd + N/d2 + N/d3. To be even, among N/d2,N/d3 exactly one odd -> exactly one of d2,d3 even.
But d2 already odd. So d3 must be even. Good.

So: under f even, d3 even.

Now pinpoint d3. Let E=2 d2.
E divides N: N=2k, d2|k -> yes.
Any even divisor of N besides 2: form 2u with u|k odd, u>=d2 (d2 smallest odd). So any even divisor besides2 is at least 2d2=E. So E is minimal even divisor besides2.
Now d3 is an even divisor besides2 (we just got). So d3 >= E.

What if d3 > E? E is divisor of N, distinct from d1=2,d2, and E < d3. Then among divisors besides1: 2, d2, E are three <d3; so d3 wouldn't be third smallest. Contrad. So can't have d3>E. So d3=E=2d2. Exact.

So for N=2k non-3, if f(N) even, necessarily d2 odd, d3=2 d2.

Now mod3 of f(N).
Again N nonzero mod3, d_i nonzero mod3.
Same criterion: f(N) divisible by3 <-> d1+d2+d3≡0 mod3.
d1=2. d3=2d2. So sum=2+ d2 + 2 d2=2 + 3d2 ≡2 mod3. Never 0. So 3 ∤ f(N). Exactly. Contrad if assumed. So (ii) done. So lemma A proved. Good.

So: even non-multiple-of-3: next term is strictly smaller (part (i)), and if next term even, it's still non-multiple of 3 (part (ii)). Exactly what we need.

Now main Lemma 2: In any infinite valid orbit, all terms are multiples of 3.

Suppose some term X=a_s even, not multiple of 3.
All terms even (Lemma 1), so X' = a_{s+1}=f(X) is even.
X even non-3: by Lemma A(i), f(X) < X; A(ii) with f even -> f(X) not div by3.
So a_{s+1} even non-3, smaller. Same lemma applies again. Induction:
for t>=s: a_t even, not divisible by3; a_{t+1} < a_t. Infinite strictly decreasing positive integers. Impossible. So cannot exist. So no term non-multiple of3.
So: **every a_n is divisible by 3 as well as by 2.** So all a_n divisible by 6.

So far: any valid infinite sequence: all terms multiples of 6, none odd.

Perfect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Analyze terms divisible by 6.

So now: each a_n divisible by 6, and even.

Look at any term N in orbit.

When N divisible by6. Two possibilities: divisible by4 or not.

If N not divisible by4: v2(N)=1.
It's divisible by2,3 but no 4.
So smallest divisors >1: d1=2, d2=3 always.
Third d3:
- If 5|N: then d3=5 (<6).
- If 5∤N: d3=6 (since N divisible by6 always).
So two subcases.

If d3=5: triple (2,3,5). Formula f(N)=N/2+N/3+N/5=31N/30.
Now N divisible by30 but not by4 -> N=30k k odd. So f(N)=31k odd.
So successor is odd => impossible (Lemma 1: no odd term). So cannot occur.
So in orbit, when term divisible by6 but not by4: 5 cannot divide it.

So then d3=6. So for such N: d1,d2,d3 =2,3,6. Then f(N)=N/2+N/3+N/6=N. So fixed point.
So any term divisible by6 but not by4 in a valid orbit must avoid 5, and is a fixed point.
So exact set of fixed points: {N: N divisible by6, but not by4, not by5}. Good.

So: In any valid orbit: if ever meet term not divisible by4, from that term on, sequence constant (fixed point). Great.

So now structure: any valid orbit is eventually constant fixed point (multiples of 6, v2=1, no factor 5). Possibly from start.

Need show indeed any orbit must hit such term finitely soon. Show can't stay divisible by4 forever.

Suppose, to contrary, all terms always divisible by4. We've already lemma2: all terms divisible by3. So all terms divisible by12 always.
If N divisible by12: smallest divisors >1 are 2,3,4. So f(N)= N/2 + N/3 + N/4 = 13N/12.
So if all a_n divisible by4 forever: recurrence for all n: a_{n+1}=13 a_n /12.
So exact: a_n = (13/12)^{n-1} a_1. In particular v3(a_{n+1})=v3(a_n)-1 every step (because multiply by 13/12, 1 factor 3 subtracted, nothing added). Start v3(a_1) finite. After t=v3(a_1) steps, v3(a_{t+1})=0, so a_{t+1} not divisible by3. But lemma2 said all a_n divisible by3. Contrad.
So can't have all terms divisible by4 forever.

So: there is first time a term is not divisible by4. Exactly.

Let
T := min { n>=1 : 4 ∤ a_n }. Finite by above.
So a_T divisible by6 but not by4.

By analysis above of non-4 multiples of6: in orbit, such term must be fixed point: must not be divisible by5, and then f=identity. So a_T is fixed point; hence a_{T+1}=a_T, a_{T+2}=a_T, ... constant from time T onward.

So any valid infinite orbit: becomes constant at first non-4 term. Good.

Now examine preceding terms (if any): n<T.
By definition of T, for n<T, 4 | a_n. And always 3|a_n. So for n<T, a_n divisible by12.
So for each n=1,...,T-1: three smallest divisors of a_n >1 are 2,3,4. So f(a_n)=a_n/2 + a_n/3 + a_n/4 = 13/12 a_n.
So for n=1,...,T-1: exact relation a_{n+1} = 13/12 * a_n. So strictly increasing before T.

So whole orbit structure: finite initial increasing chain with ratio 13/12 each step, then constant fixed point from time T onward. Exactly.

Now parameterize.

Value at time T (=first non-4) is fixed point: divisible by6, not by4, not by5.
So a_T = 6 U, U odd positive, 5 ∤ U. Exactly family of fixed points.

Now for earlier terms:
a_1 = (12/13)^{T-1} * a_T.

Let L = T-1 (could be 0). So a_1 = (12/13)^L * 6 U.

Need a_1 integer. gcd(12,13)=1, gcd(6,13)=1. So need 13^L | U. So U=13^L V for some integer V.
So V positive. U odd, 5 not divide U -> same for V: V odd, 5 not divide V.

So a_1 = (12/13)^L * 6*13^L*V = 6*12^L * V.

So necessary form:
\[
a_1 = 6 \cdot 12^L \cdot V, \quad L\ge 0 \text{ integer},\ V\ge1 \text{ odd},\ 5\nmid V.
\]
So that's necessity.

So classification so far.

Now sufficiency: show any such a_1 indeed works.

So fix L>=0 integer, odd V>0, 5 ∤ V. Set a_1=6*12^L V. Define sequence by rule a_{n+1}=f(a_n). Need show it's valid infinite.

If L=0: a_1=6V. Divisible by6 not by4 or5 (V odd, 5∤V). Its smallest divisors >1: 2,3,6. f(a_1)=a_1. So constant from start. Every term same; has at least proper divisors {1,2,3}; good. Valid.

Now L>=1.

I'll show explicit formula for first L+1 terms:
Claim: for 1<=n<=L+1:
a_n = 6*12^{L-n+1}*13^{n-1}*V.    (call it (*))

n=1: true.

Inductive for n<=L:
Assume formula for a_n. Exponent of 12: L-n+1>=1, so a_n divisible by12 -> in particular by3 and by4.
Any number divisible by3 and by4: smallest divisors >1 are exactly 2,3,4. So for N=a_n (n<=L), d1=2 d2=3 d3=4.
So recurrence: a_{n+1}=a_n/2+a_n/3+a_n/4=13 a_n/12.
Plug in formula for a_n -> get a_{n+1}=6*12^{L-(n+1)+1}*13^n V. Exactly formula for n+1. Induction. So (*) holds for n=1..L+1.

So a_L divisible by12, a_{L+1}=13/12 a_L = 6*13^L V.

Now check a_{L+1}: a_{L+1}=6 U with U=13^L V. V odd -> U odd. V not divisible by5 -> U not divisible by5. And 13^L odd. So a_{L+1} divisible by6, but its 2-adic val is exactly 1 (only from 6), so not divisible by4. Not divisible by5. So a_{L+1} is exactly from fixed point set.

So d1,d2,d3 of a_{L+1}: 2,3,6. So f(a_{L+1})=a_{L+1}/2+a_{L+1}/3+a_{L+1}/6=a_{L+1}. So from index L+1 on, constant equal to a_{L+1}. So indeed defined forever.

Also each a_n has at least three proper divisors:
for n<=L, a_n divisible by12 -> divisors {1,2,3,4,6,...}, at least three proper.
n>=L+1 constant at a_{L+1}, divisible by6 -> has {1,2,3} at least.
So all good. So sequence valid infinite. Exactly.

So sufficiency done.

So exact set of possible initial values is precisely that family.

So answer set:
\[
\boxed{ a_1 = 6 \cdot 12^L \cdot V,\ L=0,1,2,\ldots,\ V \text{ odd positive},\ 5\nmid V. }
\]

That's full.

Checks: L=0: a_1=6*odd, gcd(odd,5)=1 -> precisely numbers divisible by6, odd quotient, not multiple 5, i.e., divisible by6 but not by4 or5: fixed points. L>=1: first is 72*odd not mult by5, exactly preimages, longer chains 864*odd not mult 5, etc. Exactly.

That's complete.

\(\boxed{}\)
